## What is it?
`OpsML` is a library which simplifies the machine learning project lifecycle.

## Features:
  - **Simple Design**: Standardized design that can easily be incorporated into existing workflows.

  - **Cards**: Track, version, and store a variety of ML artifacts via cards (data, models, runs, pipelines) and a SQL-based card registry system. Think "trading cards for machine learning".

  - **Automation**: Automated processes including Onnx model conversion, api generation from Onnx model, data schema inference, code conversion and packaging for production.

## Installation:

### Poetry

```bash
poetry add opsml
```

### Pip

```bash
pip install opsml
```

Setup your local environment:

By default, `opsml` will log artifacts and experiments locally. To change this behavior and log to a remote server, you'll need to set the following environment variables:


```shell
export OPSML_TRACKING_URI=${YOUR_TRACKING_URI}
```

## Usage

Now that `opsml` is installed, you're ready to start using it!

It's time to point you to the official [Documentation Website](https://thorrester.github.io/opsml-ghpages/) for more information on how to use `opsml`


## Advanced Installation Scenarios

`Opsml` is designed to work with a variety of 3rd-party integrations depending on your use-case.

Types of extras that can be installed:

- **Postgres**: Installs postgres pyscopg2 dependency to be used with `Opsml`
  ```bash
  poetry add "opsml[postgres]"
  ```

- **Server**: Installs necessary packages for setting up an `Fastapi`/`Mlflow` based `Opsml` server
  ```bash
  poetry add "opsml[server]"
  ```

- **GCP with mysql**: Installs mysql and gcsfs to be used with `Opsml`
  ```bash
  poetry add "opsml[gcs,mysql]"
  ```

- **GCP with mysql(cloud-sql)**: Installs mysql and cloud-sql gcp dependencies to be used with `Opsml`
  ```bash
  poetry add "opsml[gcp_mysql]"
  ```

- **GCP with postgres**: Installs postgres and gcsgs to be used with `Opsml`
  ```bash
  poetry add "opsml[gcs,postgres]"
  ```

- **GCP with postgres(cloud-sql)**: Installs postgres and cloud-sql gcp dependencies to be used with `Opsml`
  ```bash
  poetry add "opsml[gcp_postgres]"
  ```

- **AWS with postgres**: Installs postgres and s3fs dependencies to be used with `Opsml`
  ```bash
  poetry add "opsml[s3,postgres]"
  ```

- **AWS with mysql**: Installs mysql and s3fs dependencies to be used with `Opsml`
  ```bash
  poetry add "opsml[s3,mysql]"
  ```
