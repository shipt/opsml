# Ownership

In lots of organizations there is often a seperation of concerns between data science and engineering (including cybersecurity) when it comes to data science tooling. Thus, with something like `Opsml` it's appropriate to think "who owns what?" or "where does data science and engineering fit into the lifecycle, use, and management of a system like this?". With something like `Opsml`, the goal is to provide an interface into infrastructure that data scientists use and engineering owns/controls. The diagram below is one example of this seperation of concerns.
